# StudioCMS Login Test

A repo containing a basic Astro website that is used to test how the new StudioCMS login screen could look.

## Adding new Background Images
To add a new background image, put it in the `public/` dir. Afterwards, head to the `src/scripts/three.ts` file and add your 
filename & type to the array in line `14`. If you want to contribute a new image that might end up being used in the StudioCMS 
dashboard rebuild, please provide a dark & light variant.
